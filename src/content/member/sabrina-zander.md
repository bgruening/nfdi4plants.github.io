I support the [SFB1535 MibiNet](https://www.sfb1535.hhu.de/mibinet) at [HHU](http://hhu.de/) with data stewardship. 
Within DataPLANT, I act as a bridge between researchers and developers to ensure that tools and services — including [elab2arc](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/elab2arc), which connects elabFTW with ARCs — are developed in line with users’ needs. I also support documentation and knowledge sharing through the [DataPLANT knowledge base](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/)
 and [training events](/events/).
