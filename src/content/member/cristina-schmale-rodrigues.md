Hi! I’m Cristina, and I manage and coordinate DataPLANT and represent the consortium within the [NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/). My responsibility is to set the framework so that our data stewards and developers can focus on what they do best. I act as a bridge between all work areas, communicating with spokespersons, developers, data stewards, and, most importantly, the whole research community. I really enjoy bringing the right people together and making sure everyone is connected. Together, we’re working towards a big goal: making plant science research data more FAIR and easier to use for everyone.
