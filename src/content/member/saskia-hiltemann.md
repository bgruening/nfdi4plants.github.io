Within DataPLANT, I lead the Data Steward Circle and am involved in user support. I am also a Data Steward for the [MAdLand](https://madland.science) project, as well as for the [Central Data Facility](https://uni-freiburg.de/cdf-en) of the University of Freiburg.

I am also very active in the Galaxy community, where I create tools and workflows for researchers, and I lead the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyprojec.org).
