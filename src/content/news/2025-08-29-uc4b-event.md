At the end of August, the 2nd UC4B Base4NFDI event was held in Aachen, back-to-back with the [CoRDI conference](https://www.nfdi.de/cordi-2025/), 
starting on Thursday afternoon directly after CoRDI. Base4NFDI is an initiative aimed at developing and providing a set of common, shared 
research data management (RDM) enabling services for the NFDI community. DataPLANT is particularly engaged in IAM4NFDI and Accounting4NFDI. 
Within the Accounting4NFDI working group, members suggested a contribution to basic service (to start beginning of next year)
[*Towards Integrated Resource Accounting in NFDI*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16736160). This accounting initiative follows up on joint 
tests and contributions previously presented at the 1st UC4B in Berlin in November 2024.  

Base4NFDI follows an iterative three-step process to develop its basic services, ensuring a participatory roll-out while fostering consensus 
across the NFDI community. By August 2025, several basic services had reached different stages of technical maturity. The Aachen event offered 
an opportunity to exchange on the future development of NFDIâ€™s basic infrastructure. Discussions focused on the roles and requirements of 
service providers, spanning from foundational storage and compute resources to higher-level services such as Galaxy workflow system ontop
of de.NBI Cloud resources, InvenioRDM (the technical base of the [ARChive in DataPLANT](https://archive.nfdi4plants.org/)), or the 
[PLANTdataHUB](https://git.nfdi4plants.org/explore).
