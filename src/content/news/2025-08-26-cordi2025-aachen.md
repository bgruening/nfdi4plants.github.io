The second edition of the [Conference on Research Data Infrastructure (CoRDI)](https://www.nfdi.de/cordi-2025/) took place from 
26 to 28 August 2025 at RWTH Aachen University, hosted by the colleagues from NFDI4Ing. DataPLANT speakers, developers, and data 
stewards joined the three-day event, which featured keynotes, lectures, poster sessions, and the “market of opportunities.” The 
conference brought together national and international stakeholders from diverse research fields and infrastructures. CoRDI stands 
for generating more knowledge through better use of research data and the added value this brings to society.

DataPLANT members contributed actively across several formats. In the sustainability track and the joint life sciences panel, 
they participated in:

- [*Building to last – Strategic Approaches to a sustainably funded Institutional Research Data Management*](https://zenodo.org/records/16735927)  
- [*Synergy in Life Sciences – Joint strategies and services for national and European collaboration between NFDI consortia*](https://zenodo.org/records/16736338)

They also presented multiple contributions during the extensive poster sessions on the first two days, including:

- A joint poster with Text+ and BERD on InvenioRDM: [*InvenioRDM in NFDI: Advancing FAIR Data Across Domains*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16735931)  
- NFDI4BIOIMAGE activities with links to DataPLANT: [*Open Source Platform for Scalable Multi-Purpose Virtual Desktop Infrastructures*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16735885)  
- Participation in the Accounting4NFDI working group: [*Towards Integrated Resource Accounting in NFDI*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16736160), as a follow-up to ongoing activities in IAM4NFDI  
- ARC posters highlighting the uptake and developments of the Annotated Research Context and RDM strategy in plant sciences and beyond:  
  - [*Making RDM Measurable: A Case Study in ARCs*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16735876)  
  - [*Automated Ontology Term Mapping for Enhanced Research Data Annotation*](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16736111)  
- Updates on Data Management Plan (DMP) activities in DataPLANT and beyond:  
  - [*DataPLAN’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server: Enhance AI Support for Data Management Plans*](https://zenodo.org/records/16736082)  
  - [*Towards interoperability of DMPs among different services in Life Sciences – On the example of DMP exchange between DataPLAN and RDMO*](https://zenodo.org/records/16735286)

During the “market of opportunities” on the second and third day, DataPLANT engaged with other consortia, using the chance to exchange 
ideas and explore ways to deepen the BioData SIG collaboration. On Wednesday, a back-to-back meeting of the common infrastructure section and 
the Overall Architecture working group (in common infrastructure section) provided an opportunity to discuss future developments in NFDI’s basic 
infrastructure and the implications of the upcoming DFG storage call.
