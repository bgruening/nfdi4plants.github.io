Within the first funding period of DataPLANT, one focus of the Research Data Management (RDM) activities has been 
exploring strategies for long-term access to research data. This has included partnering with experts and other 
consortia to advance the topic. Alongside active participation in the NFDI Long-Term Archiving (LTA) working 
group, we now aim to extend our cooperation with the German nestor Initiative.

The currently dormant nestor Emulation Working Group is preparing to resume and renew its activities. A call for 
participation has been issued, particularly addressing memory institutions.

The University of Freiburg, as the applicant institution of DataPLANT, has previously been an active member of 
the [German nestor Initiative](https://www.langzeitarchivierung.de)contributing especially to emulation as a 
method for long-term access to dynamic digital objects.

To support the re-establishment of the nestor Emulation Working Group, the Freiburg LTA team – closely linked to 
DataPLANT – has launched a short survey. We kindly invite RDM professionals and enthusiasts to participate and 
to share the link within their networks (of memory institutions): [Take the survey here](https://www.umfrageonline.com/c/wqzu4cww)

The call is coordinated with Svenia Pohlkamp (German National Library, nestor project office). The Working Group 
will be co-led by Klaus Rechert (Hochschule Kehl) and Dirk von Suchodoletz (University of Freiburg), both also 
active within the NFDI/DataPLANT context.

Your feedback on the community’s interest in emulation and on potential focal points for the Working Group will 
be invaluable in shaping its future activities. The survey takes approximately five minutes to complete and 
remains open until 13 October 2025. The survey can be completed anonymously; institutional details are optional. 
All responses will be used solely for the stated purpose and deleted afterwards. Neither raw data nor evaluations 
will be published.
